# an operator in python is a symbol that performs an operation on values and variables.
'''
#1. ARITHMETIC OPERATOR:

#a. additon.
print(2+2) = 4 # here 2 is operand and the (+) symbol is the operator.
#b. substraction.
print(3-2) = 1
#c. multiply.
3*5 = 15
#d. division.
print(6/3) = 2
#e.floor division.
print(10 / 3) = 3 # will get the answer without any decimal.
#exponentiation
print(3**4) = 81
#modulus
print(15%2) = 1 # will get only the decimal part but not in literal way but after the division, the amount that you cannot do division with as whole integer form.
'''

'''
# 2. COMPARISON OPERATOR.

# a. equal to.
print(2 == 3) 
# b. not equal to .
print(2 != 3)
# c. less than
print(2 < 3)
# d. greater than 
print(2 > 3)
# e. greater than or equal to
print(2 >= 3)
# f. less than or equal to
print(2 <= 3)

'''
#variable: variable is a temporary container where we can store values.
my_first_variable = 2 # here we are storing values inside this container called variable.
print(my_first_variable) # we can check it using print function.

# how to name a variable
# 1. the first character has to be small or capital letter. - A, b
# 2. it cannot have number or special as the first lettr but after the first letter(small letter) - %$&*
# 3. first letter can have a underscore (_). - _my_variable
# 4. python reserved keywords, always try to use them as variable names.
# 5. case sensitive. python recognizes small and capital letter differently. try to keep that in mind. a, A
