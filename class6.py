#dictionary
''' for example in oxford dictionary there are some words and then the meaning of those words. but a word can have multiple meaning . in python the dictionary works exactly the same. there are two main things . one is key whcih stands for the word and the value which stands for meaning . just like dictionary a key can have multiple values but not vice versa. 
'''

'''
dict1 = {'key': 'value'}
print(dict1['key'])
'''

'''
dict2 = {
    'one':{'hasib': 'god gifted'},
     True:2,
    'three':3,
    'list': [1,[2,3,4],5],
    'tuple': (1,2,3)
}
#in dictionary the keys can have only data types like string, integer and float and boolean
#while values can have both data types and structures like in addition list, set, tuple.

print(dict2['one'])
print(dict2[True])
print(dict2.keys())
print(dict2.values())
