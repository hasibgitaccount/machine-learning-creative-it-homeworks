#dictionary
''' for example in oxford dictionary there are some words and then the meaning of those words. but a word can have multiple meaning . in python the dictionary works exactly the same. there are two main things . one is key whcih stands for the word and the value which stands for meaning . just like dictionary a key can have multiple values but not vice versa.

dict1 = {'key': 'value'}
print(dict1['key'])
